# Challenge-03

This week we were assigned with generating a site that completes the password generator criteria. 

I took the original site provided and added specific password requirements in the form a checkbox. I am currently struggling to have the javascript portion of the 
assignement display as text. My plan is to request a tutor so the assignment can be properly submitted and graded so the javascript can work properly.
